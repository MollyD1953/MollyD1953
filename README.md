- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MollyD1953
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning JMRI with my trains. I'm new to all this ( just ordered my Arduino). I plan first to get that installed and running. Afterwards I hope to install a sketch called back and forth. This created questions in my mind. Do I need a second copy of JMRI on my computer or will it run multiple programs off one copy ? Still trying to figure out if it will be compatible with my Chromebook. Arduino has created software for their end.

Any info on these or other issues you think I should know would be appreciated.
